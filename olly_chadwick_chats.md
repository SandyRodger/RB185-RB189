to discuss:

- favicon middleware (am i allowed to use lint?)
- Safari doesn't render the code
- tests
- Is it ok how i enter new sets? (ie, it's not shown what the exercise ids are).
- Interview assessment
- Is it too complicated ? (What should be cut?)
- Is it ok that the exercise summary table does not allow deletion.
- Are my paths ok (too many? illogical? Page numbers?)
- logins?

Next:

- why does my css take so long to apply?
